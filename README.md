# Programming in Scala

This is the repository for the ESIEE 2017-DRIO-5201C-Scala. 

The syllabus of the course is available [here](Syllabus.pdf).

The current list of projects proposals is available [here]((Syllabus.pdf)), please pick one and notify me ideally by the second class.

### Course Material
The book that we will be using during the course is:

- ***Programming in Scala***, 3rd Ed. By Martin Odersky et al.

The [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) website also contains several links to useful learning material. 

While this is a scala Course, I'll be using from time to time [Haskell](http://haskell.org) and [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) to explain some core functional programming concepts as it provides a more succint and extremely clear syntax. If you want to deepen your understanding of functional programmign and in particular of Haskell I suggest the following two books:

- ***Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming***, 2nd Ed by Simon Thompson.

- ***Thinking Functionally with Haskell***, by Richard Bird

For OCaml there are quite a few good books available online:

- [Real World Ocaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org)
- [Various online OCaml books](http://ocaml.org/learn/books.html)


### Software
Make sure that your laptop has intsalled:


- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)* 

- [Scala Build Toool](http://www.scala-sbt.org)** 



(*) You can use Eclipse but in my experience IntelliJ works much better.

(**) While you could get by installing only IntelliJ I also want you to have direct experience with SBT. Thus install it.


### Optional Software

If you want to be able to run the Haskell examples that I'll be using during the course you'll need to install the haskell platform by following the instructions available [here](https://www.haskell.org/downloads). 

Likewise, if you want to run the OCaml examples pleas install ocaml through the [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org) package manager.
